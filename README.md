# Exif Notes

Exif Notes is an Android application that let's you quickly make notes on the field when doing film photography. It allows you to save important data related to your photography gear (cameras, lenses, filters etc.) and photos (film rolls, frames, aperture, shutter speed, location etc.). In addition, it helps you to attach these notes to your scanned files as exif data by integrating with ExifTool by Phil Harvey (https://exiftool.org/). Exif Notes generates complete command line commands to write the data to your scanned files. This way applications and websites that display exif data are able to show them for your film photos as well.
